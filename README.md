### Reasoning
In the XDS Team we need to implement complex animations for our components. And we have fantastic ones already implemented. When done right, animations can attract user’s attention, improve their experience, and reduce cognitive load. I believe that there is still much room for improvement in terms of animations in the XING product, and therefore, I would like to dig deeper into this topic during this week, taking into account, of course, the assistance and tools that artificial intelligence offers nowadays: Chat GPT and Copilot specially.
