### Reasoning
In the XDS Team we need to implement complex animations for our components. And we have fantastic ones already implemented. When done right, animations can attract userâ€™s attention, improve their experience, and reduce cognitive load. I believe that there is still much room for improvement in terms of animations in the XING product, and therefore, I would like to dig deeper into this topic during this week, taking into account, of course, the assistance and tools that artificial intelligence offers nowadays: Chat GPT and Copilot specially.
